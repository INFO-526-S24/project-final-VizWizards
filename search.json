    "text": "Description and Motivation:\nThe data set Meteorite_Landings.csv, which will be used for this project has been sourced from NASA’s Open Data Portal. It contains the complete set of information of all known meteorite landings on Earth. The dimensions of the data set include 10 variables total which consist of 6 numerical and 4 categorical variables, across 45716 observations. The reason why this data set was chosen was because of the opportunity to scientifically explore all the factors that go into studying how and why meteorites land on specific parts of the Earth. Using this data set, the project could explain the reasons behind certain historical events and predict the most vulnerable places for meteorite crashes which could help in their scientific study and research in fields such as astrology, data analysis and geology.\n\nMetadata\nThe data includes 10 variables- 6 numerical and 4 categorical.

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\n\nWhat does the distribution of meteor impacts look like across the earth?\n\nWhich continents have accumulated the most total mass of meteors?\n\nHow do historical events relate to the observations and discoveries of meteors?\nWhat trends may be observed in frequency, type, or location of meteors, and can they be related to known celestial events? \nMeteor crashes may be unpredictable, but they are not simply random events. Meteors are often determined to be the stray ejecta of debris from other celestial bodies. Therefore, we expect trends in observed meteor falls to correspond to notable celestial events, such as earth’s passing by different celestial bodies, including comets, planets, and the moon.\nTherefore, we are interested in identifying statistically significant trends in the meteor data and attributing these data to specific events in time and space. For example, clusters of small but frequent meteor crashes may be observed during regular meteor-shower events like the Lyrids, which is a consequence of earth’s passing through the debris trail of the Comet Thatcher. \nIntegrating this information with meteor impact visualizations will offer our audience a  rich model of earth’s place in the solar system, and its myriad interactions with other celestial bodies."
