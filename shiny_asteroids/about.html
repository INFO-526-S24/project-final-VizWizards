<p>By analyzing variables such as mineral composition and trajectory, scientists are able to hypothesize which heavenly bodies meteors originate from.</p> 

<p>Meteorites create dramatic, bright displays as the meteorite enters Earth's atmosphere. Is there a relationship between these events and Eath's proximity to known parent bodies?</p> 

<p>This application is designed to analyze a specific subset of our meteor dataset, focusing on observed meteorite falls from 1980-2010 that are thought to originate from one of four asteroids: Vesta, 6 Hebe, 8 Flora, and Itokawa.</p>  

<p>In addition to meteorite fall observations, positional asteroid data is used to determine parent body distance from earth, and allow spatial relationships to be visualized in 3D.</p>
