# Meteoric Fall: a comet-ment to data

Final project repo for INFO 526 - Spring 2024.

## Shiny Apps

[Shiny App for Asteroid Orbits](https://jgaiser.shinyapps.io/app1/)

[Shiny App for Meteor Landings](https://gmcginnis.shinyapps.io/MeteoriteMap/)

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to develop a Shiny app using the Meteorite Landings dataset, enabling users to explore and analyze meteorite landings data through dynamic visualizations. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, dataset information, key questions to be addressed, and potential insights.

## Dataset

The dataset Meteorite_Landings.csv has been sourced from NASA's Open Data Portal. It contains comprehensive information on all known meteorite landings on Earth.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

- Create an interactive platform using Shiny app to explore and analyze meteorite landings data.
- Provide users with dynamic visualizations to enhance their understanding of meteorite landings on Earth.
- Answer key questions regarding the distribution of meteor impacts across the Earth, the continents with the most accumulated total mass of meteors, and the relationship between historical events and meteor observations.
- Explore trends in the frequency, type, and location of meteorites and their correlation with known celestial events.
- Generate insights that contribute to scientific research in fields such as astrology, data analysis, and geology.
