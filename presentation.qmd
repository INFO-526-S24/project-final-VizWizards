## Introduction {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

-   This project aims to understand how meteorites impact historical events and celestial phenomena using data visualizations.
-   A Shiny app has been made to visualize data, focusing on animated timelines, static maps, leaflet maps, and custom maps to analyze where meteorites land and their historical and celestial contexts.

## Understanding the Dataset {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

-   The data set Meteorite_Landings.csv, has been sourced from NASA's Open Data Portal.
-   The dimensions include 10 variables i.e. 6 numerical and 4 categorical variables.


# Question 1 {.smaller transition="zoom-in concave-out"}

What does the distribution of meteor impacts look like across the earth? - Which continents have accumulated the most total mass of meteors?

## Meteorites recorded before and after falling {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

## Insights {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

::: incremental
<div>

-   The top 2 locations of the heaviest meteors that fell were reported to be near the Kazakhstan border along Russia and in parts of USA.
-   Only the USA and a majority of Australia seem to have the maximum recorded visuals of meteors in the whole world.
-   It is also surprising to note that while a lot of meteors were sighted in the USA, there was almost a negligible count of sightings recorded in its neighboring country, Canada.
-   The country with the maximum number of sightings of fallen meteors is India and the continent with most sightings of meteors before falling is Europe.

#### Insights from the Leaflet Plot

- The map allows you to explore meteorite sightings across the entire world showcasing clustered concentrations in certain regions.
- By clicking on individual meteor markers on the map, you can access detailed information about each meteorite(year it fell, its mass, its classification and position)
- The continents that have accumulated the most total mass of meteors are Europe and Asia.

# Question 2 {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

How do historical events relate to the observations and discoveries of meteors?

## Question 2 - Plots {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A {.smaller}
### Time Series of Meteor Observations by Year
```{r time_series_plot}

historyEvents <- image_read(here("images", "historyOfEventsHoriz.gif"))

historyEvents
```

#### Insights {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}
- Only slight increase in observations towards the end of the Space Race
- Huge spike resulted in observations resulted from the Yamato Mountains Expedition
- Also a large spike during and after the last Leonid showers
- It does in fact seem to be the case that an increase in observations follows meteor showers
:::

# Question 3 {.smaller transition="slide-in convex-out"}

Are trends observed in frequency, type, or location of meteors, related to known celestial events?

## Conclusion

::: {smallerTxt}
-   Created an easy-to-use platform using Shiny app technology, making it simple for anyone to explore and visualize meteorite data.

-   Our project helps uncover where meteorites land and what impact they have historically, providing clear insights into these phenomena.

-   By analyzing historical data, we aim to predict future meteorite impact sites, potentially aiding decision-making processes and scientific discussions.

-   Our goal was to make meteorite research accessible to everyone, fostering curiosity and understanding in fields like geology and astronomy.
